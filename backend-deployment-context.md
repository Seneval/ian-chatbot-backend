# Backend Deployment Context - MongoDB Integration

## Current Situation

You're now in the `ian-chatbot-backend` repository. The backend code has been updated with full MongoDB integration and needs to be deployed to Vercel.

## What Was Done

1. **MongoDB Integration Added**:
   - Backend now connects to MongoDB Atlas on startup
   - All client data, sessions, and messages are persisted
   - Usage tracking with automatic monthly resets
   - Full analytics API with aggregation pipelines
   - Fallback to in-memory storage if MongoDB unavailable

2. **Admin Dashboard Enhanced**:
   - Real-time usage statistics display
   - Visual warnings for high usage and overdue payments
   - Analytics modal with detailed metrics
   - Conversation logs viewer with message history
   - Export conversations to JSON functionality

3. **Files Already Updated**:
   - `src/index.js` - MongoDB connection on startup
   - `src/api/auth.js` - Client CRUD operations with MongoDB
   - `src/api/chat.js` - Session and message persistence
   - `src/api/analytics.js` - Real data queries
   - `src/models/*` - All Mongoose models ready

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Add MongoDB Connection String to .env

Create or update `.env` file in the backend root:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://ian-admin:Inp6moes!@ian-chatbot-cluster.zbnthrx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=ian-chatbot-cluster
```

### 2. Verify Dependencies

The `package.json` should already include mongoose. If not:
```bash
npm install mongoose
```

### 3. Commit and Push to Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add MongoDB persistence with full analytics

- Connect to MongoDB Atlas on startup
- Implement usage tracking and analytics
- Add session and message persistence
- Update all endpoints to use MongoDB models"

git push origin main
```

### 4. Add Environment Variable to Vercel

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your `ian-chatbot-backend` project
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add:
   - Name: `MONGODB_URI`
   - Value: `mongodb+srv://ian-admin:Inp6moes!@ian-chatbot-cluster.zbnthrx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=ian-chatbot-cluster`
   - Select all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### 5. Verify Deployment

After Vercel deploys:
1. Check deployment logs for "✅ MongoDB connected successfully"
2. Test the admin panel at https://inteligenciaartificialparanegocios.com/admin/
3. Create a test client and verify data persists
4. Check usage statistics are being tracked

## Important Notes

- The `.env` file should NOT be committed (verify it's in `.gitignore`)
- The system will work without MongoDB (falls back to in-memory)
- All existing in-memory data will be lost when switching to MongoDB
- New data will be persisted in MongoDB Atlas

## Features Now Available

- ✅ Permanent data storage
- ✅ Usage tracking per client
- ✅ Monthly usage limits with visual indicators
- ✅ Payment status tracking
- ✅ Full conversation history
- ✅ Analytics with date ranges
- ✅ Export conversations
- ✅ Real-time statistics in dashboard

Once deployed, your chatbot system will have full persistence and analytics capabilities!
